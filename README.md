**About**

Here are some guidelines and articles about this subject.

My suggestion is to use first **Rubocop** in order to cleanup the offenses (see process just below). Later on with **RubyCritic** and also with **Rubocop** but on a codereview/refactoring based activities.

```
$ rubocop --format offenses
``` 

Once they are listed, they can be arranged in a to-do list disabled at first generated in a file by the following commands and then it is possible cope with them little by little:

```
$ rubocop --auto-gen-config
$ rubocop .
:
$ ls -la .*.yml
:
-rw-r--r--  1 enogrob  staff  77011 Sep 29 12:55 .rubocop_todo.yml
```
